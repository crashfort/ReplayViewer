# ReplayViewer

Steps 1 to 3 only have to be done once, or when respective programs have to update.

1. Download SourceMod https://www.sourcemod.net/downloads.php and Metamod https://www.metamodsource.net/.
2. Extract SourceMod and Metamod archives into cstrike.
3. Extract ReplayViewer archive from the release page into cstrike.
4. Start the game with `-insecure` or start from `svr_launcher.exe`.
5. Start the map you have a replay for using the console command `map <name>`.
6. Place new replays into `addons/sourcemod/data/replay_viewer/replays`.
7. Use the replay viewer chat command to open the interface `/replay_viewer` or `!replay_viewer`. **This must be typed in the chat and not the console, because any command inserted in the console will be executed as the server, and not the client.**
8. Load all the replays you want to play.
9. Join spectator and watch. You can use `startmovie` now from SVR.
