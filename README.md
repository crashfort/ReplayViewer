2. Extract SourceMod and Metamod archives into cstrike.
3. Extract ReplayViewer archive from the release page into cstrike.
4. Start the game with `-insecure` or start from `svr_launcher.exe`.
5. Start the map you have a replay for using the console command `map <name>`.
6. Use the replay viewer console command to open the interface `sm_replay_viewer`.
7. Load all the replays you want to play.
